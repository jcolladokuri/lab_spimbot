For our strategy, we wanted to randomize which angle the bot would turn in. To do this,
we took advantage of the timer because the timer was a different number every
single second of the run time. We took the remainder of the time with 360 and we made
this the angle. By modding it with 360, this would ensure that the angle remains valid
and that the bot can travel in that location.

We also tried to save an inventory to keep track of the power ups. At every tile,
we tried to pick up the power up if there was one. However, we failed to finish up on this.

One problem we faced was that the bot was running out of paint buckets and we
were failing on getting more paint buckets. Because of this, we could only paint
a maximum of 50 tiles.
